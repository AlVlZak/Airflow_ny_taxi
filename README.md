## Project Overview
This project leverages Apache Airflow to automate and orchestrate the entire data processing workflow. It includes tasks for data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL), as well as tasks for generating reports and visualizations.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, you will need to have Apache Airflow installed. You can follow the installation instructions in the [official Apache Airflow documentation](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/start/index.html).

Once you have Airflow set up, you can clone this repository and configure your Airflow environment to run the provided DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs) for data processing.

## Data Sources
The primary data source for this project is the New York City taxi trip data. You can obtain the dataset from [https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page](link_to_data_source). Make sure to place the dataset in the appropriate directory before running the pipeline.

## Pipeline Structure
The pipeline is organized into several DAGs, each responsible for a specific aspect of data processing. Here's an overview of the main DAGs:
- **ETL DAG**: This DAG extracts the raw taxi trip data, performs data cleaning and transformation, and loads it into a database.
- **Analytics DAG**: This DAG runs various analytics tasks on the cleaned data, generating insights and visualizations.
- **Report DAG**: This DAG generates reports based on the analytics results and stores them in a specified location.

Feel free to explore the code and DAG configurations to understand the pipeline's structure and functionality in more detail.

## Usage
To run the pipeline, you can trigger the DAGs using the Apache Airflow web interface or the command line. Refer to the Airflow documentation for instructions on how to trigger and monitor DAGs.
