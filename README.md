# Airflow New York Taxi Data Pipeline

This repository houses a data pipeline built with Apache Airflow for processing New York City taxi data. The pipeline performs various data transformations and analyses on the taxi trip data, providing valuable insights and visualizations.

## Project Overview
This project leverages Apache Airflow to automate and orchestrate the entire data processing workflow. It includes tasks for data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL), as well as tasks for generating reports and visualizations.

## Getting Started
To begin using this project, you will need to have Apache Airflow installed. You can follow the installation instructions in the [official Apache Airflow documentation](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/start/index.html).

Once you have Airflow set up, clone this repository and configure your Airflow environment to run the provided Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) for data processing.

## Data Sources
The primary data source for this project is the New York City taxi trip data, which can be obtained from [this source](https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page). Ensure that you place the dataset in the appropriate directory before running the pipeline.

## Pipeline Structure
The pipeline consists of one DAG responsible for a specific aspect of data processing. Here's an overview of the main DAG:
- **ETL DAG**: This DAG extracts the raw taxi trip data, performs data cleaning and transformation, and loads it into a database.

Additionally, there are scripts available for executing various analytical tasks.

Feel free to explore the code and DAG configurations to gain a deeper understanding of the pipeline's structure and functionality.

## Usage
To run the pipeline, you can trigger the DAGs using the Apache Airflow web interface or the command line. Refer to the Airflow documentation for instructions on how to trigger and monitor DAGs.
